# Ninja Developer by Yagasaki
How to define what level of development I am?

# What is a ninja?
The word "ninja" refers to a Japanese warrior trained in martial arts, guerrilla warfare and espionage. Ninjas emerged in feudal Japan during the Sengoku period (1467-1603) and were known for their ability to move silently and infiltrate enemy locations undetected.

# Similarity between a ninja and a developer
While it might seem that there aren't many similarities between a ninja and a developer, there are some traits that can be compared.

Just like a ninja, a developer needs to be skilled in their field, have specific skills and technical knowledge in programming, in addition to being able to work efficiently and accurately. Developers also need to be able to work well in a team and adapt quickly to changes, much like a ninja working in a team on covert missions.

Furthermore, both ninjas and developers often work in highly competitive environments and need to stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies to be successful in their activities.

Finally, both ninjas and developers need to be highly focused on their objectives and goals, as well as having a strategic mindset to achieve them efficiently and effectively.
